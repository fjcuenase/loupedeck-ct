# âœ… Photoshop 2025 Plugin Fix for ARM Devices (Surface Pro with Snapdragon)

This repository provides a working solution for two known compatibility issues on ARM devices running Photoshop 2025 or Photoshop 2025 Beta.

ðŸ“… Tested on **April 11, 2025**  
ðŸ’» Device: **Surface Pro 11th Edition with Snapdragon (ARM)**  
ðŸ›  Photoshop Versions: **Photoshop 2025** & **Photoshop 2025 Beta**

---

## ðŸš« The Problems

### 1. **Loupedeck Installer 6.1** doesn't work with Photoshop  
### 2. **Logi Plugin** cannot be installed on ARM devices

---

## âœ… Solution 1: Use Loupedeck Installer 5.9

Loupedeck 5.9 works flawlessly with Photoshop.

ðŸ”— Download it here:  
[LoupedeckInstaller_5.9.1.19364.exe](https://5145542.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/5145542/Knowledge%20Base/LD%20Software%20Downloads/5.9.1/LoupedeckInstaller_5.9.1.19364.exe)

## âœ… Solution 2: Manually Install the Logi Plugin

### Why the plugin doesn't install automatically:
- **Loupedeck Installer** blocks installation on ARM.
- **Creative Cloud Desktop** also prevents installation on ARM.

### My workaround:
1. Install the plugin on a **Windows x64 device**.
2. Copy the plugin folder from that device to your ARM device manually.

ðŸ“¦ Plugin ZIP download:  
[Download Plugin for Photoshop ARM](https://github.com/fjcuenase/loupedeck-ct/blob/main/loupedeck-ct-plugin-photoshop-arm.zip)

### ðŸ—‚ Where to copy the plugin:

- On x64:  
  `C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\UXP\Plugins\External\a3cd5ec5_6.0.45207`

- On ARM (create folders if necessary):  
  `C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\UXP\Plugins\External\a3cd5ec5_6.0.45207`

### âœ… Why this works:
Because the plugin is written in **JavaScript**, which is architecture-independent â€” it works on both x64 and ARM.

## ðŸ§ª Result

âœ” The plugin is now running perfectly on:
- **Photoshop 2025**
- **Photoshop 2025 Beta**
